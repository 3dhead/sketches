# resources dir

Note: This directory gets copied to `docs/` and is "deployed" as part of the gallery. So,
this `resources` directory should only include files you are okay being checked into the
repo and will be used directly by the sketches. In other words, no pre-transformed source
data! Put that somewhere else and then place the smaller, processed version of the data
here in the `resources` directory.
