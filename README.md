# sketches

all my sketches i think?

Take a look here: [rolyatmax.github.io/sketches](https://rolyatmax.github.io/sketches/).

To run locally, you'll need to have `canvas-sketch-cli` installed.

Run a specific sketch:
```
npm run dev sketches/my-sketch.js
```

To build (first install imagemagick and canvas-sketch-cli):
```
npm run build
```

Older sketches and scripts can be found at [commit `e328189`](https://github.com/rolyatmax/sketches/tree/e32818944ca3827f4376d624c5669b252e2f799f).
